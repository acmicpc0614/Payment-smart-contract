# Mysterium Network payments [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mysteriumnetwork/payments-smart-contracts.svg?token=t9FwiYsxwDxkJWnSMpfr&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mysteriumnetwork/payments-smart-contracts)

Set of smart contracts needed for mysterium identity registration and working with payment channels (using payment hubs).

## Documentation

* [Payments solution white paper](docs/paper/accountant-pattern.pdf)

## Setup and test

We're using truffle for smart contract compilation and running tests.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run local ethereum node, e.g. `ganache`.

```bash
npx ganache-cli --port 7545
```

3. Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

4. Testing migration/deployment
```bash
npm run migrate
```

## Current deployment (ethereum Ropsten testnet)
ERC20 Token (Mintable a la myst token): [https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x453c11c058f13b36a35e1aee504b20c1a09667de](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x453c11c058f13b36a35e1aee504b20c1a09667de)

Registry smart contract:

## Ideas to discuss

* Bidable DEX (no centralised rate, each bidder can suggest own rate, conversion always on market price)
* Stateless Proxy (mutates target's storage, avoids delegatecall)
* Downvoting for provider identity (if client already paid some amount to identity) -> downvoting can take some funds from stake
* Virtual channels (Counterfactually or Perun based).
* Get fee from channel during deployment instead of from `msg.sender`.
* `msg.sender` could get reward for registration directly from channel during `initialize` stage.
