Staking
=======

To avoid potential negative views on registration fee and have better double spent prevention mechanisms, there is staking proposal.

**Staking can help with:**

* There is no central authority which is getting registration fee what leads into even better decentralisation.
* We can allow to increase stake what should be positive impact for identity rating.
* When there is something on stake, users will have more motivation to stick to current identity and not create new one.
